# pladecode

Tool for decoding mask programmed PLAs from die shots

## Disclaimer
The code of this tool is still in very active development and will be cleaned up once all 
core features have been implemented 

## Contributors

The project was started by Peter Bosch, and includes small amounts of (mostly UI) code from
rompar (https://github.com/AdamLaurie/rompar) by Adam Laurie et al. 

## Usage

For now, the tool is not considered complete or fit for end users. When it does reach that 
point, I will add usage information here.
